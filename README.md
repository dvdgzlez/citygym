=======

A small project to manage the payments of users in a gym.

Originally created with Java, and using MySQL database... 

Right now I want to migrate this project and use it with Java DB...

Also I'll be starting soon this same project in Python (first own project), if you wan't to contribute you can contact me to any of my accounts.
